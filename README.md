# Torvald Application 
Torvald Application is a console-based project  which acts like a menu driven system where the interface lets you interact with a computer or device by working your way through a series of screens or menus. In this program User is prompted with (6 choices)for the user to gain access to the menu application they must enter there first name or full name is he/she desires  

In addition to creating the program, I learned more about Menu-Driven-Interface and how they affect our day to day life as they are practical. They also prompts the user to enter a response or command where the user waits for the system to respond to the command entered and be prompted to enter the next command or option. we interact with them everywhere.

I created a menu to allow the users to navigate their way through the program in the simplest way possible. The menu could allow you to choose between an array of options, i.e.; Pattern Application, Fibonacci Series and Palindrome Application. I also took the initiative to allow the user to view the menu again every time they have finished using the previous application.
